I'm a data scientist but humanist who thinks caffeine is the nectar of the gods. Yes, I believe in God. I love discovering new gadgets, media, and content as much as I love discovering new places, but I prefer to live life on the edge with spontaneous trips. I have a strong faith in a higher power and I'm on a quest to find my purpose in this vast universe. In my free time, you can find me sipping coffee and pondering the meaning of life.
