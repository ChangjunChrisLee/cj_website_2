I’m a data scientist and humanist who believes caffeine is the nectar of the gods. With a strong faith in a higher power, I’m on a quest to find my purpose in this vast universe. My research interests span technology, particularly AI and emerging media, people, and culture. I am dedicated to exploring how society interacts with and is transformed by these advancements.

I lead the Culture & Technology Convergence Lab, where we focus on technology, management, and policy to enhance joyful and healthy living. In my free time, you’ll often find me sipping coffee, discovering new gadgets, media, and content, or embarking on spontaneous trips while pondering the meaning of life.
