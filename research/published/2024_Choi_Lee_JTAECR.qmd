**Abstract**

The objective of this manuscript is to investigate the determinants influencing the selection of over-the-top (OTT) platforms as opposed to traditional television mediums—cable, Internet protocol television (IPTV), and satellite broadcasting—for the consumption of content such as television shows and films. Employing data extracted from the 2020 Media Panel comprising 423,851 observations garnered from personal media diaries, this study scrutinizes the impacts of individual attributes, environmental conditions, and temporal factors on platform choice. The findings reveal a temporal influence characterized by a “Friday effect” and a heightened preference for OTT platforms during early afternoon (12:00–16:00) and late-night hours (00:00–04:00). Notably, the likelihood of selecting OTT platforms is significantly augmented during the late-night period in comparison to other time frames. In relation to individual characteristics, variables such as male gender, younger age, higher educational attainment, and elevated income levels were positively correlated with a predilection for OTT platforms. Additionally, environmental variables such as possession of an unlimited data plan and ownership of a tablet personal computer also emerged as significant predictors for OTT preference. Furthermore, the presence of a beam projector during late-night hours and residing in a household with multiple occupants during afternoon hours also served as contributing factors for OTT utilization. In conclusion, the study offers critical insights for stakeholders in both traditional television and burgeoning OTT markets, providing data-driven recommendations for the strategic allocation of resources in consideration of day-of-week and time-of-day variables.
