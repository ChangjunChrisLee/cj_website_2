**Highlights**

-   The fake news problem in the national disaster situations is a critical issue.

-   The quantitative effect of fake news from the audience’s perspective is still unknown.

-   We analyzed the willingness-to-payment for the public fact-checking systems.

-   A household’s willingness-to-payment is 10,652 KRW (9 USD), on average.

-   Individuals with psychological damage and high reliance on news answer higher payment.

**Abstract**

As the battle with COVID-19 continues, an Infodemic problem has been raised. Even though the distribution of false news in national disaster situations has been reported for a long time, little attention has been given to the quantitative research of the fake news problem from the audience’s perspective. This study, therefore, aims to estimate how much tax taxpayers would gladly pay for a virtual public-run fact-checking system. Using a one-and-one-half bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method, a survey was conducted on 525 respondents in Korea, and the spike model was applied to distinguish zero willingness-to-pay (WTP). The results show that a household’s WTP for the public fact-checking system is 10,652 KRW (9 USD), on average, in the form of income tax for five years. Given the amount is a regular payment in perpetuity, the total WTP is estimated at 23 billion KRW ($196 M) every year. The result also shows that an individual’s WTP increases as his or her psychological damage caused by fake news is high, as well as his or her high reliance on news in a disaster situation.
