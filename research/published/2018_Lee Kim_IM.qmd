**Highlights**

-   We integrate users into visualization and analysis of an ICT ecosystem with user data.

-   We propose a simple method of showing evolutionary trends in the ICT ecosystem.

-   We broaden the ecosystem layer model by using users' media repertoire concept.

-   The evolutionary trends of firms and layers help practitioners make a strategic decision.

**Abstract**

We integrate users into the visualization and analysis of an information and communication technology (ICT) ecosystem by using demand-side data. We also broaden the ecosystem layer model by using a media repertoire concept and propose a clear method of showing evolutionary trends. Consequently, we discover the nature of an evolutionary path in an ICT ecosystem. This path becomes more rigid and centralized as it matures, a finding that agrees with prior studies' results that used supply-side data. Further, we analyze the trends of firms changing layer positions and suggest multiple approaches of visualizing and analyzing interfirm relationships for practitioners.
