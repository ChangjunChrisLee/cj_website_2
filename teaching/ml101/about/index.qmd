## Course description

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Goal

This course covers the fundamentals of the field, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, regression, classification, and clustering. The course may also cover topics such as model evaluation, feature selection, and regularization.

In a supervised learning setting, students learn about linear regression and logistic regression, as well as more complex algorithms such as Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and kNN. They learn how to train models on a labeled dataset and make predictions on new data.

In an unsupervised learning setting, students learn about clustering algorithms such as k-means and Apriori. They learn how to extract meaningful structure from unlabeled data.

The course may also cover advanced topics such as natural language processing. Students learn how to implement and use these algorithms in R.

Throughout the course, students work on practical projects and assignments to apply the concepts they have learned. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the basics of machine learning and be able to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

-   **Lecturer:** Changjun Lee (Associate Professor in SKKU School of Convergence)

    -   [changjunlee\@skku.edu]{.underline}

-   **TA:** Haeyoon LEE (Ph.D. Student, SKKU Interaction Science)

    -   [haileysunny\@naver.com]{.underline}

<!-- -->

-   **Time:**

    -   (1h): Flipped learning content

    -   (2h): **Tue** 09:00 \~ 10:50

-   **Location:** [70527] 중앙학술정보관 Active Learning Classroom(70527)

<br>

> Class consists of **Pre-class**, **Class**, and **PBL project**

-   **Pre-class**

    -   Students will be required to watch the lecturer’s recorded lecture (or other given videos) before the off-line (or online streaming ZOOM) class and learn themselves

    -   Video is about the concept of the data science and the programming language

    -   (Sometimes) Students are required to submit Discussions to check the level of their understanding

-   **Class**

    -   Lecturer summarize the pre-class lecture and explain more details

        -   Ask students about the pre-class content to check whether they learned themselves

        -   OK to answer incorrectly, but if you cannot answer at all, it will be reflected in your pre-class discussion score.

    -   Students will practice with the advanced code

    -   A Quiz will be in the class to check the level of understanding

-   **PBL project**

    -   Students organize teams that meet several conditions.

        -   4\~5 members in a team

        -   Background diversity: no homogeneous majors in a team

        -   Exception: Allowed if persuasion is possible for sufficient reasons

    -   Data will be given. Teams are going to choose the data they want to explore considering their interest

    -   Teams can offer a zoom meeting with lecturer if they need

<br>

## Final outputs (An example not limited)

-   Data Preparing (or Collecting)

-   Explore data (Descriptive stats)

-   Set your hypothesis (or research questions)

-   Visualize data to confirm your hypo or RQs

-   Explain your findings

-   Expanding your findings to implications

<br>
