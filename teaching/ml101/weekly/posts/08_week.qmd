## Data

> We are going to use a dataset named 'penguins' from the 'palmerpenguins' package. The dataset contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The penguins dataset is useful for learning R, because it contains multiple kinds of data (both categorical and numeric variables).

-   Please see the link below if you want to know more about this data. <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html>

## **QZ**


### Part I. Data Import & Exploration

Let's import "Palmerspenguins" data (Use the code below)

```{r}
# Install palmerpenguins pacakge (if required)
if(!require(palmerpenguins)){
  install.packages("palmerpenguins")
}

# import libraries
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

data(penguins)
```

Let's have a glimpse of the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

The **`penguins`** dataset consists of 344 observations and the following 8 variables:

1.  **`species`**: A factor with three levels - Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. These are the three penguin species under study.

2.  **`island`**: A factor with three levels - Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. These are the islands in the Palmer Archipelago where the penguins were observed.

3.  **`bill_length_mm`**: A numeric variable representing the length of the penguin's culmen (bill) in millimeters.

4.  **`bill_depth_mm`**: A numeric variable representing the depth of the penguin's culmen (bill) in millimeters.

5.  **`flipper_length_mm`**: A numeric variable representing the length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters.

6.  **`body_mass_g`**: A numeric variable representing the penguin's body mass in grams.

7.  **`sex`**: A factor with two levels - male and female.

8.  **`year`**: An integer variable representing the year of observation (2007, 2008, or 2009).


> There are three species in palmerspenguins: Chinstrap / Gentoo / Adelie

The data table looks like ..
```{r}
knitr::kable(penguins %>% head(10))
```

### Part II. Data wrangling


### Part III. Train the model (Modeling)


### Part IV. Model score & Prediction


### Part V. Code submission (Upload your R file)
