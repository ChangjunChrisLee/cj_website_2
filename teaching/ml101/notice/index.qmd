## Course Design

<br>

-   **Pre-class**

    -   Prior to attending the offline (or online streaming Zoom class), students are expected to view the recorded lecture delivered by the lecturer.

        -   They are encouraged to take an active role in their learning by studying the material independently.

        -   The video covers the fundamental concepts of the Machine Learning algorithm, including its underlying theory when necessary.

        -   To assess their level of understanding, students are required to submit discussion posts. This serves as a means for evaluating their comprehension of the material.

-   **In-class**

    -   During the class, the lecturer will summarize the pre-class lecture and provide additional clarification on the concepts covered.

    -   To reinforce their understanding, students will engage in hands-on practice with more advanced code. This will provide them with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and develop their coding skills.

-   The official in-class time is AM 10:00 \~ 12:00

## Grading
<br>

| Items                 | Ratio (%) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Attendance            | 0         |
| Discussion Submission | 20        |
| QZ #1 & QZ #2         | 50        |
| IC-PBL Final Score    | 30        |
| Total                 | 100       |

<br>

- When attendance falls below 1/3 in a class, it may result in a grade of F.

  - This policy is in place to encourage regular attendance and ensure that all students have the opportunity to fully participate in the learning experience. It is the responsibility of the students to attend classes regularly and stay engaged in their education.

-   The Final Score for the ICPBL is calculated by multiplying the ICPBL Team Score with the Individual Peer Review Score.

-   Individual Peer Review Scores are obtained through an anonymous survey conducted within the group.

-   It is worth noting that the team assignment is only available for domestic students. On the other hand, exchange students are required to complete an individual project.
