#### Course description

Welcome to **Cultural Industry & Data Analytics course** (a.k.a. Data Science 101), designed to equip you with the essential skills to analyze, visualize, and communicate data effectively. Over the course of 15 weeks, you will delve into the fundamentals of data science, master the power of R programming, and learn how to create interactive visualizations and websites to showcase your findings.

Throughout the course, you will learn how to import, manipulate, and explore data using R and the tidyverse. You will gain hands-on experience with data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation techniques. Additionally, you'll dive deep into data visualization with ggplot2 and learn how to create advanced, interactive plots using Shiny and plotly.

By the end of the course, you will have completed a data science project that demonstrates your ability to analyze, visualize, and communicate complex data insights. You will also learn the importance of collaboration, version control, and reproducible research in data science projects. With a solid understanding of the concepts and tools covered, you will be well-prepared to apply your skills in various real-world applications.
