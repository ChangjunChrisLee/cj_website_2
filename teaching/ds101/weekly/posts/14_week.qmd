**Quarto?**

Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose. Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more.

Quarto basics

This is a Quarto file -- a plain text file that has the extension `.qmd`:

It contains three important types of content:

1.  An (optional) **YAML header** surrounded by `---`s.
2.  **Chunks** of R code surrounded by ```` ``` ````.
3.  Text mixed with simple text formatting like `# heading` and `_italics_`.
