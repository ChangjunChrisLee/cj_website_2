### Introduction

Social scientists are increasingly turning to network analysis as a way to gain insights into the structure and dynamics of social systems. Network analysis allows researchers to examine how social actors are connected to one another, how information and resources flow through social networks, and how social networks shape individual behavior and collective outcomes. In this course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques of network analysis and explore how they can be applied to social science research using the R programming language.

Hands-on practice with R will be an integral part of the course. Students will use the R programming language to manipulate, visualize, and analyze network data. R packages such as `igraph`, `statnet`, `vizNetwork`, and `networkD3` will be used for network visualization, analysis, and modeling. Students will be provided with R code and examples to practice the concepts covered in class. Assignments and projects will require students to apply their knowledge of network analysis to real-world social science problems using R.

This course is designed for graduate students and researchers in social sciences who want to expand their research methods and explore new avenues for analysis using R. Prior experience with R is not required, but students should be comfortable with basic statistical analysis and have some familiarity with programming concepts. By the end of this course, students will have a solid understanding of network analysis in social science research and the ability to apply it using R. They will be able to use their new skills to explore social systems and gain insights into how social networks shape individual behavior and collective outcomes.
