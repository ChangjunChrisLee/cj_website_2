### Introduction

In today's digital age, vast amounts of data are being generated in the form of text, sound, image, and video. Unstructured data, in particular, holds tremendous potential for social science research, as it can reveal insights that would be difficult or impossible to obtain through traditional methods. However, working with unstructured data requires specialized skills and techniques, which many social scientists may not possess.

This course, ***Unstructured Data Analysis for Social Science Research***, is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively analyze unstructured data. Throughout the 15-week course, students will learn how to collect, preprocess, and analyze text, sound, image, and video data, and how to integrate different forms of unstructured data to gain deeper insights. They will also explore ethical considerations related to using unstructured data and best practices for presenting findings.

By the end of this course, students will have a deep understanding of the potential of unstructured data in social science research and the skills needed to analyze it. They will be able to apply their knowledge to real-world problems, and they will have a portfolio of projects demonstrating their ability to work with unstructured data. The course is suitable for graduate students and researchers in social sciences who want to expand their research methods and explore new avenues for analysis, as well as professionals who work with data in a social science context.
